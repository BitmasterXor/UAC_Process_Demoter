<h1>Process Demoter</h1>

<p>This Delphi VCL application demonstrates how to create a simple tool to execute applications at a lower UAC level using user tokens. This tool allows users to select an `.exe` file and run it with reduced privileges, which can help improve overall system performance by deprioritizing resource-heavy applications.</p>
